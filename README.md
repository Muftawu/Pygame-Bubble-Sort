# Pygame-Bubble-Sort

This is a simple python script I wrote to simulate
the bubble sort algorithm using pygame.

The script contains a python class that takes in various 
radius and sorts them from lowest to highest. After the sorting,
the result is used to draw 'n' number of circles for the 'n' radius 
given, of course in ascending order.

Thus, circles with least or small radius's are drawn first before circles
of large radiuses
